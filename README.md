# Welcome to the Advanced Immersive Learning Environment repository



## Introduction
This repository contains basic instructions for developing workflows to create, process, and run content in the 3D Stereoscopic Igloo installation of the Advanced Immersive Learning Environment.

The Advanced Immersive Learning Environment is a stereoscopic visualisation facility located in room 101 of the Advanced Engineering Centre, which contains the following equipment:

- 8 x 5000 lumen HD/WUXGA UST projectors with 3D (projected on four walls).
- 2 x 5100 lumens HD/WUXGA projectors with 3D (projected on the floor).
- IMP III Media player
- 5.1 Surround Sound system
- Server cabinet with network switch plus peripherals
- 10 x 3D glasses and 3D emitter
- Igloo Elite Software Package
- 8 PrimeX 13 OptiTrack Camera Systems
- OptiTrack MOTIVE Body Software
- T3D Mocap Suit - Summer- Men - MEDIUM - Black/Blue
- OptiTrack Marker Set 14mm w/ X-Base

## Basic workflows when using the Igloo
1. [360 Images](#360-images)
2. [360 Video from an HTTP link](#360-video-link)
3. [360 Video from a file](#360-video-file)
4. [3D Environment (e.g. Unity, Unreal)](#3d-environment)
5. [Blender](#blender)
6. [Architecture Software](#architecture-software)
7. [Google Map](#google-maps)

### 360 Images
#### Creating 360 images
A 360 image can be created with a variety of cameras, including [GoProMax](https://gopro.com/en/gb/shop/cameras/max/CHDHZ-202-master.html) and [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/).Below is an example of a 360 image as well as the stereoscopic 360 image acquired with a Insta360 Pro2 camera.
