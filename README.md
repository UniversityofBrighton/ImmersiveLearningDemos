### 360 Images
#### Creating 360 images
A 360 image can be created with a variety of cameras, including [GoProMax](https://gopro.com/en/gb/shop/cameras/max/CHDHZ-202-master.html) and [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/).

Below is an example of a 360 image as well as the stereoscopic 360 image acquired with a Insta360 Pro2 camera.
